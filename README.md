### Accordion component made with HTML/CSS/JS

Used HTML, CSS and JS

Made component with two children divs, left and right side.
In right side I used flexbox where I changed the direction of flow to columns.
In right side using absolute positioning and transform() I positiond 3 images like in design.
Made changes in MediaQuery for all screen sizes.

Animation is made on box ilustration img with css animation.

In JS i fist I selected all .faq-div's then with foreach i added .active class in first question as default behavior when site is loaded.

Every time a .faq-div is clicked, all elements get their class .active removed (if they have), then on selected class .active is added.
