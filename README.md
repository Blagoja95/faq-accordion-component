### Accordion component made with HTML/CSS/JS

Used HTML, CSS and JS

Made component with two children divs, left and right side.
In right side I used flexbox where I changed the direction of flow to columns.
In right side using absolute positioning and transform() I positiond 3 images like in design.
Made changes in MediaQuery for mobile.

In JS i used toggle method to check if .active class was present in .question elements.
